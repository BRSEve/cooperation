# code of multi-agent collaborate RL-Route algorithm<br>
The code of multi-agent distributed cooperative routing algorithm based on reinforcement-learning.
We have tune the hyperparameters.<br>
## Project description
We conduct the packet routing simulation on a large-scale dynamic network in order to cope with the issues caused by movement of nodes.And we carry out experiments for both a fixed large topology having 49 nodes and a topology where a small amount of nodes move respectively.<br>
