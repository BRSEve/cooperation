# code of multi-agent collaborate RL-Route algorithm<br>
The code of multi-agent distributed cooperative routing algorithm based on reinforcement-learning.
We have tune the hyperparameters.<br>
## Project description
In order to tackle the routing problem in large-scale dynamic networks, we conduct the packet routing simulation on a large-scale network whose partial node's location changes.And we carry out experiments for both a fixed large topology and a topology where a small amount of nodes move respectively.
